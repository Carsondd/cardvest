# CardVest Capital â€” Investor-Only Collectibles (Starter)

This is a ready-to-run Vite + React + Tailwind project containing the landing page you saw in chat.

## Quick start

1. Install Node.js 18+.
2. Open a terminal in this folder and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the local URL printed in the terminal (typically http://localhost:5173).

## Build for production
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Notes
- Auth in this starter is mocked (buttons just toggle state). Hook up your real auth when ready.
- Styling uses TailwindCSS utility classes (already configured).
- Animations use Framer Motion. Icons via lucide-react.
